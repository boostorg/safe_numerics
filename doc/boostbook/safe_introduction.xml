  <section id="safe_numerics.introduction.problem">
    <title>Problem</title>

    <para>Arithmetic operations in C++ are NOT guaranteed to yield a correct
    mathematical result. This feature is inherited from the early days of C.
    The behavior of <code>int</code>, <code>unsigned int</code> and others
    were designed to map closely to the underlying hardware. Computer hardware
    implements these types as a fixed number of bits. When the result of
    arithmetic operations exceeds this number of bits, the result will not be
    arithmetically correct. The following example illustrates this
    problem.</para>

    <programlisting>int f(int x, int y){
    // this returns an invalid result for some legal values of x and y !
    return x + y;
}
</programlisting>

    <para>It is incumbent up the C/C++ programmer to guarantee that this
    behavior does not result in incorrect or unexpected operation of the
    program. There are no language facilities which do this. They have to be
    explicitly addressed in the program code. There are a number of ways to do
    this. See<link linkend="INT32-C"><citation>INT32-C</citation></link> seems
    to recommend the following approach.</para>

    <programlisting>int f(int x, int y){
  if (((y &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (x &gt; (INT_MAX - y))) 
  || ((y &lt; 0) &amp;&amp; (x &lt; (INT_MIN - x)))) {
    /* Handle error */
  }
  return x + y;
}
</programlisting>

    <para>This will indeed trap the error. However, it would be tedious and
    laborious for a programmer to do alter his code to do. Altering code in
    this way for all arithmetic operations would likely render the code
    unreadable and add another source of potential programming errors. This
    approach is clearly not functional when the expression is even a little
    more complex as is shown in the following example.</para>

    <programlisting>int f(int x, int y, int z){
    // this returns an invalid result for some legal values of x and y !
    return x + y * z;
}
</programlisting>

    <title>Solution</title>

    <para>This library implements special versions of int, unsigned, etc.
    which behave exactly like the original ones EXCEPT that the results of
    these operations are guaranteed to be either arithmetically correct or
    invoke an error. Using this library, the above example would be rendered
    as:</para>

    <programlisting>#include &lt;boost/safe_numeric/safe_integer.hpp&gt;

safe&lt;int&gt; f(safe&lt;int&gt; x, safe&lt;int&gt; y){
  return x + y; // throw exception if correct result cannot be returned
}
</programlisting>

    <para>The addition expression is checked at runtime or (if possible) at
    compile time to trap any possible errors resulting from incorrect
    arithmetic behavior. This will permit one to write arithmetic expressions
    that cannot produce an erroneous result. Instead, one and only one of the
    following is guaranteed to occur.</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the expression will yield the correct mathematical
          result</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the expression will emit a compilation error.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the expression will invoke a runtime exception.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>In other words, the <emphasis>library absolutely guarantees that no
    arithmetic expression will yield incorrect results</emphasis>.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="safe_numerics.introduction.summary">
    <title>Implementation</title>

    <para>All facilities modern C++ are employed to minimize runtime overhead
    required to make this guarantee. In many cases there is no runtime
    overhead at all. In other cases, small changes in the program are required
    to eliminate the runtime overhead. The library implements special versions
    of int, unsigned, etc. named <code>safe&lt;int&gt;</code>,
    <code>safe&lt;unsigned int&gt;</code> etc. These behave exactly like the
    original ones EXCEPT that expressions using these types fulfill the above
    guarantee. These types are meant to be "drop-in" replacements for the
    built-in types they are meant to replace. So things which are legal - such
    as assigning an signed to unsigned value are not trapped at compile time -
    as they are legal C/C++ code - but rather checked at runtime to trap the
    case where this (legal) operation would lead to an arithmetically
    incorrect result.</para>

    <para>Note that the library addresses arithmetical errors generated by
    straightforward C/C++ expressions. Some of these arithmetic errors are
    defined as conforming to C/C++ standard while others are not. So
    characterizing this library as addressing undefined behavior of C/C++
    numeric expressions is misleading.</para>

    <title>Additional Features</title>

    <para>Operation of safe types is determined by template parameters which
    specify a pair of <link linkend="safe_numerics.promotion_policies">policy
    classes</link> which specify the behavior for type promotion and error
    handling. In addition to the usage serving as a drop-in replacement for
    standard integer types, Users of the library can:</para>

    <title>Scope</title>

    <para>This library currently applies only to built-in integer types.
    Analogous issues arise for floating point types but they are not currently
    addressed by this version of the library. User or Library defined types
    such as arbitrary precision integers can also have this problem. Extension
    of this library to these other types is not currently under development
    but may be addressed in the future. This is one reason why the library
    name is "safe numeric" rather than "safe integer" library.</para>
