    <title>Arithmetic Expressions Can Yield Incorrect Results</title>

    <para>When some operation on signed integer types results in a result
    which exceeds the capacity of a data variable to hold it, the result is
    undefined. In the case of unsigned integer types a similar situation
    results in a value wrap as per modulo arithmetic. In either case the
    result is different than in integer number arithmetic in the mathematical
    sense. This is called "overflow". Since word size can differ between
    machines, code which produces mathematically correct results in one set of
    circumstances may fail when re-compiled on a machine with different
    hardware. When this occurs, Most C++ compilers will continue to execute
    with no indication that the results are wrong. It is the programmer's
    responsibility to ensure such undefined behavior is avoided.</para>

    <para>This program demonstrates this problem. The solution is to replace
    instances of <code>char</code> type with <code>safe&lt;char&gt;</code>
    type.</para>

    <programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/example1.cpp"
        parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

    <para>Note that I've used <code>char</code> types in this example to make
    the problem and solution easier to see. The exact same example could have
    been done with <code>int</code> types albeit with different values.</para>

  <section id="safe_numerics.tutorial.2">
    <title>Arithmetic Operations Can Overflow Silently</title>

    <para>A variation of the above is when a value is incremented/decremented
    beyond it's domain. This is a common problem with for loops.</para>

    <programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/example2.cpp"
        parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

    <para>When variables of unsigned integer type are decremented below zero,
    they "roll over" to the highest possible unsigned version of that integer
    type. This is a common problem which is generally never detected.</para>

    <title>Implicit Conversions Can Lead to Erroneous Results</title>

    <para>At CPPCon 2016 Jon Kalb gave a very entertaining (and disturbing
    example) <ulink
    url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtFGa6XJDU">lightening talk</ulink>
    related to C++ expressions.</para>

    <para>The talk included a very, very simple example similar to the
    following:</para>

    <para><programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/example4.cpp"
          parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting></para>

    <para>A normal person reads the above code and has to be dumbfounded by
    this. The code doesn't do what the text - according to the rules of
    algebra - says it does. But C++ doesn't follow the rules of algebra - it
    has it's own rules. There is generally no compile time error. You can get
    a compile time warning if you set some specific compile time switches. The
    explanation lies in reviewing how C++ reconciles binary expressions
    (<code>a &lt; b</code> is an expression here) where operands are different
    types. In processing this expression, the compiler:</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Determines the "best" common type for the two operands. In
          this case, application the the rules in the C++ standard dictate
          that this type will be an <code>unsigned int</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Converts each operand to this common type. The signed value of
          -1 is converted to an unsigned value with the same bit-wise
          contents, 0xFFFFFFFF, on a machine with 32 bit integers. This
          corresponds to a decimal value of 4294967295.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Performs the calculation - in this case it's,
          <code>&lt;</code>, the "less than" operation. Since 1 is less than
          4294967295 the program prints "b is less than a".</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>In order for a programmer to detect and understand this error he
    should be pretty familiar with the implicit conversion rules of the C++
    standard. These are available in a copy of the standard and also in the
    canonical reference book <citetitle><link linkend="stroustrup">The C++
    Programming Language</link></citetitle> . (both are over 1200 pages
    long!). Even experienced programmers won't spot this issue and know to
    take precautions to avoid it. And this is a relatively easy one to spot.
    In the more general case this will use integers which don't correspond to
    easily recognizable numbers and/or will be buried as a part of some more
    complex expression.</para>

    <para>This example generated a good amount of web traffic along with every
    one's pet suggestions. See for example <ulink
    url="https://bulldozer00.com/2016/10/16/the-unsigned-conundrum/">a blog
    post with every one's favorite "solution"</ulink>. All the proposed
    "solutions" have disadvantages and attempts to agree on how handle this
    are ultimately fruitless in spite of, or maybe because of, the <ulink
    url="https://twitter.com/robertramey1/status/795742870045016065">emotional
    content</ulink>. Our solution is by far the simplest: Just use the safe
    numerics library as shown in the example above.</para>

    <para>Note that in this particular case, there is absolutely no extra
    overhead in using the safe integer library. Code generated will either
    equal or exceed the efficiency of using primitive integer types.</para>

    <title>Mixing Data Types Can Create Subtle Errors</title>

    <para>C++ contains signed and unsigned integer types. In spite of their
    names, they function differently which often produces surprising results
    for some operands. Program errors from this behavior can be exceedingly
    difficult to find. This has lead to recommendations of various ad hoc
    "rules" to avoid these problems. It's not always easy to apply these
    "rules" to existing code without creating even more bugs. Here is a
    typical example of this problem:</para>

    <para><programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/example10.cpp"
          parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>Here
    is the output of the above program:<screen>example 10: mixing types produces surprising results

    <code>int</code> with <code>safe&lt;int&gt;</code>.</para>

    <title>Array Index Value Can Exceed Array Limits</title>

    <para>Using an intrinsic C++ array, it's very easy to exceed array limits.
    This can fail to be detected when it occurs and create bugs which are hard
    to find. There are several ways to address this, but one of the simplest
    would be to use safe_unsigned_range;</para>

    <para><programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/example5.cpp"
          parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>Collections
    like standard arrays, vectors do array index checking in some function
    calls and not in others so this may not be the best example. However it
    does illustrate the usage of <code>safe_range&lt;T&gt;</code> for
    assigning legal range to variables. This will guarantee that under no
    circumstances will the variable contain a value outside of the specified
    range.</para>

    <title>Checking of Input Values Can Be Easily Overlooked</title>

    <para>It's way too easy to overlook the checking of parameters received
    from outside the current program.<programlisting><xi:include

          xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>Without
    safe integer, one will have to insert new code every time an integer
    variable is retrieved. This is a tedious and error prone procedure. Here
    we have used program input. But in fact this problem can occur with any
    externally produced input.</para>

    <title>Programming by Contract is Too Slow</title>

    <para>Programming by Contract is a highly regarded technique. There has
    been much written about it has been proposed as an addition to the C++
    language <citation>Garcia</citation><citation>Crowl &amp;
    Ottosen</citation>. It (mostly) depends upon runtime checking of parameter
    and object values upon entry to and exit from every function. This can
    slow the program down considerably which in turn undermines the main
    motivation for using C++ in the first place! One popular scheme for
    addressing this issue is to enable parameter checking only during
    debugging and testing which defeats the guarantee of correctness which we
    are seeking here! Programming by Contract will never be accepted by
    programmers as long as it is associated with significant additional
    runtime cost.</para>

    <para>The Safe Numerics Library has facilities which, in many cases, can
    check guarantee parameter requirements with little or no runtime overhead.
    Consider the following example:</para>

    <para><programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/example7.cpp"
          parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting></para>

    <para>In the example above the function convert incurs significant runtime
    cost every time the function is called. By using "safe" types, this cost
    is moved to moment when the parameters are constructed. Depending on how
    the program is constructed, this may totally eliminate extraneous
    computations for parameter requirement type checking. In this scenario,
    there is no reason to suppress the checking for release mode and our
    program can be guaranteed to be always arithmetically correct.</para>
